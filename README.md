# Dataset: histology landmarks

**Dataset: landmarks for registration of [histology images](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~borovji3/?page=dataset)**

The dataset consists of 2D histological microscopy tissue slices, stained with different stains. The main challenges for these images are the following: very large image size, appearance differences, and lack of distinctive appearance objects. Our dataset contains 108 image pars and manually placed landmarks for registration quality evaluation.
